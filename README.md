# Article Posting Website

## Overview

This project is an **Article Posting Website** built using **PHP**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **phpMyAdmin** 
for the database. It allows users to post articles, which are then reviewed by an admin. The admin can either accept or 
reject the articles, and the status is communicated to the publisher via email. The top approved articles are displayed 
on the home page for visitors to read.

### 4. **Home Page Display**

### 5. **Simple and Lightweight**

   - Admins can either **accept** or **reject** the article.

3. **Email Notification**:
   - Once an article is reviewed, the publisher receives an email with the status (accepted or rejected).

4. **Home Page Display**:

3. Configure the database connection:

     ```php
     $host = "your_database_host";
     $username = "your_database_username";

     $database = "your_database_name";
     ```

4. Set up email notifications:

     $smtpUsername = "your_smtp_username";
     $smtpPassword = "your_smtp_password";
     $smtpPort = "your_smtp_port";
     ```

5. Run the project:
   - Place the project folder in your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
